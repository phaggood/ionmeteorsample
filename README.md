This demo combines other demos listed below:

[ionic-meteor](https://github.com/netanelgilad/meteor-ionic-example)

[Angular-ionic Tutorial](https://angularjs.meteor.com/tutorial)

The first link uses ionic but not ui-router, the second has ui-router and angular but no ionic.  I've taken this through step 12; however the cordova build is broken.  When I fix that I'll update the demo and finish it through step 16 on the tutorial.  Using the file structure layed out in the tutorial this should suffice for an adequate starting point for a mobile meteor app using ionic, angular, cordova and meteor.


Note that the demo uses meteor's login utility so you'll have to setup with one of the oauth providers (facebook, twitter or github) or create a meteor login.

If you're looking to host your own Meteor app there's a really short tutorial showing how to deploy to ec2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11K_DSrhJzQ
